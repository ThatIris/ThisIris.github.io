            <p class='hidden popUpdesc'> Mastercard TRACK‚Ñ¢ is a suite of products & services aimed at modernizing B2B payments. Instead of targeting current market needs, its VisionType, is a forward-looking product/ marketing /sales tool to deliver a futuristic vision of how B2B payments can be reinvented 2-5 years from now. It's bolder, more strategic, and conceptual than a prototype.
            
            </br></br>
            For 2.5 months, I led weekly remote design workshops with cross-functional teams (product/business/tech...), usually of 6-9 members. The workshops were carefully designed to ensure each team member participated effectively.
           
           </br></br>
           E.g., Large teams are divided into groups of 3. After a quick creative warm-up, we'll do online white-board  brainstorming together, then start individual storyboarding, followed by in-group walkthrough of each storyboard, and eventually converge the results into one collective storyboard. The use of online co-creation tools, "diverge and converge" process , and pen & paper quick-and-dirty storyboarding approach, helped a large cross-functional team quickly iterate concepts through remote collaboration with great results.
           
           </br></br>After 5 major iterations, we arrived at a vision for B2B payment innovation that is bold enough yet well-grounded on Mastercard's unique tech and business offerings. I presented the final concept + storyboard + script to SVPs and received highly positive feedback. The project is currently handed over to other dept. as long-term engagement.

           Mastercard‚Äôs Smart Contract Platform (SCP) is a blockchain based solution that enables users to customize payments and services for their business needs.
           This prototype, as SCP's pilot, showcases its ability to help merchants create & manage typical smart contracts/agreements/templates, and oversee related transactions for usecases such as micro-payment, subscription, etc.
         </br></br>
         
         I was responsible for designing the SCP brand visuals, and the product itself. I led product discussions from beginning to end, bringing together business, tech and product team to a common vision and conducted design iterations along that. ‚Ä®‚Ä®Within 1.5 month, from wireframe to final prototype, this demo went through internal and external validations with high appraisal and successfully launched in early 2021.
         
         </br></br>
         ‚Ä®One major design challenge is to distinguish 3 abstract tech concepts- templates, contracts, and agreements for users, merchants who are laymen to these terms. I used a system of icons/slogans/infographics full of metaphors & visual archetypes borrowed from other domains to portray these concepts and their relationships to each other. And I leveraged consistent yet disparate page layouts & interactivity to subtlely signal the differences inbetween them. Follow-up user tests affirmed merchants are able to grasp these concepts intuitively without prior knowledge.

            <p class='hidden popUpdesc'> Marketplace Empower is an AI-based, data-oriented "strategist" for both sellers and marketplace managers to grow their business more effortlessly. It describes a vision where --- leveraging Mastercard‚Äôs partnership, network, and consumer data analytics capabilities --- sellers are provided with AI-based actionable insights about their business channels (with cross-marketplace benchmarking) and one-click onboard services to suggested marketplaces, etc.
            

           </br></br>
            
          
                      I led the initial online design thinking workshop where the idea was developed, and created the persona + storyboard that helped the team won leadership support. Subsequently, I designed the prototype from both seller's & marketplace manager's perspectives. It successfully gained approval from executives after 3 iterations and is currently in validation with external partners.‚Ä®
           

           </br></br>
            
                
                Since the product features rich data and insights, it is crucial to present them in a digestible way without overloading users. I applied a 4-parted vertical layout across all pages, from Title to Main Data/Insight to Breakdowns and Actions, so users can skip the details and directly perform the call-to-actions if they want. Also, to make the data/insights easier to understand, I leveraged 8 different types of graphs to visualize different types of marketplace data, and highlight the insights.

            <p class='hidden popUpdesc'> ‚Ä®As VR becomes increasingly important as a new interface and new commerce platform, Mastercard is expected to lead in this domain as a provider of innovative payment technology that is easier, safer, and more user-awesome.
        
           </br></br>
             ‚Ä®This demo contains 3 original ideas that allows the user to finish payment authentication in VR through intuitive gestures and sensory cues. They're easier to remember and perform, more fun compared to traditional ways of VR payments, and also more difficult to forge, providing the user with extra security.
  
  
        </br></br>
          I proposed 3 concepts and created the demo to present to executives. It gained strong support from leaderships including the head of MasterCard Labs R&D and was submitted for patenting and further development.
           
          
           </br></br>
            
        
        This demo was prototyped in VR for VR using Tilt Brush. ‚Ä®To better illustrate ideas, I placed them in a story where the viewer needs to purchase a ticket in order to enter the Mastercard-branded virtual "Priceless Land". To finish the purchase, VR payment comes in. ‚Ä®‚Ä®That story helps tie the ideas together, and brings the concept to life.

            <p class='hidden popUpdesc'> ‚Ä®The AR Holo-Poster augments a printed poster with various digital contents & gesture/voice-based user interactions. It demonstratess how digital contents can blend with physical interfaces/objects to create more enthralling customer experiences and better-connects cutomers to a brand.
            

            </br></br>
        ‚Ä®In this case, a user wearing a Hololens headset, can trigger different ‚Äúhidden storylines‚Äù by looking at various parts of the poster, and play along to explore the 3 key features/use-cases of MasterCard blockchain. This demo was presented in a series of events virtually including the MasterCard R&D Townhall and deployed in the Mastercard Experience Center globally.
            
            
            </br></br>
             
                 
             As its sole designer and developer, my major takeaways were:
             
             </br>
             1) Make it a guided self-discovery journey that is mildly challenging. So the poster's graphic design, plus the sound & visual in AR needs to work together to hint the user about where to look. If the user fails to spot the "hidden contents" after long enough, they get further guidances to proceed.
            
     
            </br></br>
             
                    
                    2) A hybrid visual style & design approach for a hybrid experience: The poster was designed in Photoshop by layering multiple 2D layers with depth, which is less expensive than directly designing in 3D, and allows smooth transition from a 2.5D poster to the 3D augmented world. Whereas the AR popup contents are a mix of 3D and 2D assets animated in Unity, to achieve a 3D immersive effect with less performance cost. The use of both approach, and the mindset of "designing with the hybrid experience in mind from the beginning", really helped.

               <p class='hidden popUpdesc'> Mastercard Donation Platform is a solution for busy young working professionals in their late 20s or early 30s who just want an easy way to donate to their cared causes. It makes donation super easy, transparent, and satisfying.‚Ä®
               
              </br></br>
             ‚Ä®The entire user journey is three-parted. 1) Set up regular auto-donation for one's favourite charities. 2) One-off donations to &nbsp&nbsp
               a special campaign/emergency. 3) A separate Donation Page where impacts can be tracked and adjustment can be made.
               
               </br></br>
                   
               
               My role was, first, conducting design workshops with product and tech team to clarify the problem statement - user story - product features based on our API‚Äôs tech affordances, external partner resources, and value proposition. Then, designing the demo (from low-fid wireframe to high-fid interactive prototype). The final demo was presented at the Oct 2019‚Äôs Global Inclusive Growth Summit - Washington DC, and highlighted by Mastercard CEO Ajay. Late 2019, it was white-labeled and launched for Citi Bank, among other clients.
               
        
              </br></br>
               
                Some key design decisions I made: 1) Combine data with storytelling through a personal narrative to move people to donate 2) Use social pressuring for the good 3) Slow down the experience. Design it in a way that allows it to soak into the user gradually and build up emotional ties for long-term donation commitments

             <p class='hidden popUpdesc'> Green Initiative is an attempt to encourage environmentally conscious behaviors and make the planet greener. Each Mastercard user will be rewarded with ‚Äúgreen points‚Äù for the times they take public transit, or shop in environmentally-friendly stores, etc. They can then use those green points to buy and plant real trees in their designated places, and see their impact grow over time.

             </br></br>
              
              
              
              I was responsible for designing the initial high-fid prototype in quick turnaround. My design helped the product owners win huge support from executives and it was subsequently developed into the Mastercard Priceless Planet Coalition (launched January, 2020) which promises to plant 100 million trees on the earth in 5 years.
              

              </br></br>
               
           To "nudge" the users to live greener and plant more trees: 1) Vivid colors, icons, and tree/leaf themed micro-animations were used to imbue the sense of life and hope.  2) To make users better understand their impact, it was compared to the number of vehicle's CO2 emission being reduced per year. Also the trees they have planted will show up in a 3D world map on the homepage of the app, highlighting the growing scale of their impact.  3) There's also social-media-sharings/plant-with-friends options in the app to spread the force. 4) "only 70 points away from planting your next tree.." -- Giving user the option to buy green points using their credit card to finish the next planting goal.

             <p class='hidden popUpdesc'>Chick Vacc is an app designed for Merial Animal Health Ltd. to help
            poultry farmers improve work efficiency, satisfaction, and the vaccination rate of baby chicks.
            
             I started with phone interview and went on to spend 2 days in a poultry farm.
            On-site user research became the foundation of this design.
            
            
             </br></br>

             
             Some of the key findings and their inspired design solutions:</br>
             1)  Poultry farmers have a hard time typing on a digital device while they're working, thus enabling voice input became crucial.
              
              </br></br>
               
              
              2) Farmers find it tedious, time-consuming, and not that hlepful to record the vaccination data. For that, I optimized the data recording flow with simplified steps, default bundle options, color-coded icons and micro-animations to make it simple, intuitive, and satisfying. Also the recorded data was presented in chronological order with vertical scrolling effects to be informative and pleasant to watch.
           
            </br></br>
             
             3) Farmers lack the channels to update knowledge or seek advice, and that often leads to low work efficiency and failed vaccination attempts. Thus I designed the Ask an Expert/ Farmers' Forum/ Training Videos/... section and made sure the materials are easy to understand for farmers.

            </br></br>
             
            As confirmed by follow-up interviews, the Chick Vacc app improved farmers' work efficiency and satisfaction with a 60 NPS(Net Promoter Score). It also brings a 30% increase in trackable chick vaccination rate.

            Love cassette is an interactive installation designed to connect people and spread the love we have in our heart. It can hear one's love message, and turn it into a personalized soundwave postcard on the spot. Each soundwave pattern is unique and can be customized into a
                sound-wave necklace as a souvenir.
           </br>
           </br>
            Meanwhile, scanning the QR code printed on the upper-right corner of the postcard leads to an HTML5 page where that love message is stored online and can be shared on social network or sent directly to your loved ones. That online spread of the content, in turns, recruits more participants to join the offline interactive experience, which ultimately generates more revenues for the shopping mall from increased customer number and peripheral souvenir sales.
            
           </br>
           </br>
            Love Cassette was born out of a set of constraints and a need to solve a business problem. And as all good designs do, it went on to have its own life, and influenced a set of interactive + hybrid retail experiences in China. It's the first of its kind, and still among the best.  (multi-million participants & profits)
